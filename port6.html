        <div class="topic3">
    
            <p>A computer is an electronic device that processes data according to specific instructions to produce 
                meaningful information. Computers are classified into different types based on various factors such 
                as their physical size, processing power, user capacity, and intended purpose. The main categories 
                include supercomputers, which are the largest and most powerful, designed for highly complex 
                scientific and military applications; mainframe computers, which support hundreds or thousands of 
                users simultaneously and are used by large organizations for bulk data processing; minicomputers (or 
                midsize servers), which serve medium-sized organizations with moderate computing needs; personal 
                computers (including desktops and laptops), designed for single users and general everyday tasks; 
                and workstations, which are high-performance machines tailored for professional and technical 
                applications such as graphic design and engineering. This classification framework helps to 
                understand the diverse functions, capacities, and use cases of different computer types in various 
                fields. </p>

        <h2>WHAT IS A COMPUTER?</h2>
        <div class="topic3">
    
            <p>A computer is an electronic device that operates under the control of instructions stored in its own 
                memory. It is designed to accept data as input, process this data according to specified rules or 
                programs, produce meaningful information as output, and store data for future use. The core 
                functions of a computer include taking input, processing data, storing data, producing output, and 
                controlling these operations efficiently. </p>

        <h2>TYPES OF COMPUTER</h2>

        <div class="topic2">

            <div class="discipline">

            <h3>Supercomputer</h3>
            <p>Supercomputers represent the highest tier in computing power, designed for extremely 
                complex and large-scale computational tasks. They consist of thousands of processors 
                working in parallel to perform intensive calculations at incredible speeds, suitable for scientific 
                research, weather forecasting, cryptography, and simulations of physical phenomena. 
                Supercomputers are rare, very costly, and occupy significant physical space, but they are 
                unmatched in computational ability and speed. </p>
    
        </div>
        <div class="discipline">

            <h3>Mainframe Computers </h3>
            <p>Mainframe computers are large, extremely powerful systems designed to handle and process 
                vast amounts of data for hundreds or even thousands of users simultaneously. They are 
                commonly used by large institutions, such as banks, government agencies, and corporations, 
                to support mission-critical applications including large-scale transaction processing and 
                enterprise resource planning. Mainframes feature high reliability, extensive input/output 
                capabilities, and massive storage, making them essential for heavy-duty processing 
                environments.   </p>

        </div>
        <div class="discipline">

            <h3>Mini Computers  </h3>
            <p>A mini computer, also called a midrange computer, is a mid-sized computer that falls between 
                the larger mainframe computers and smaller microcomputers in terms of size, cost, and power. 
                It is designed to support multiple users simultaneously through time-sharing technology, 
                allowing it to handle small to medium-scale business operations, educational labs, and 
                industrial automation tasks. Mini computers typically have more powerful processors than 
                microcomputers and can execute multitasking for various applications, from database 
                management to business transaction processing. They are smaller and less expensive than 
                mainframe computers but more capable and pricier than personal microcomputers.  </p>

        </div>
        <div class="discipline">

            <h3>Server  </h3>
            <p>Servers are computers dedicated to providing data, applications, and network resources to 
                other computers over a network. They vary in size and power from small, dedicated devices to 
                large, enterprise-grade machines. Servers manage tasks such as web hosting, database 
                management, file storage, and network management. Unlike personal computers, servers 
                emphasize availability, reliability, and security to serve multiple clients or users simultaneously.    </p>

        </div>
        <div class="discipline">

            <h3>Workstations  </h3>
            <p>Workstations are high-performance single-user computers specifically built for technical or 
                scientific applications that require significant computing power beyond what typical 
                microcomputers offer. These machines are commonly used by engineers, graphic designers, 
                and researchers for specialized tasks involving complex calculations, 3D modeling, and data 
                analysis. Workstations provide enhanced graphics capabilities, faster processors, and larger 
                memory capacity compared to regular personal computers.  </p>

        </div>
        <div class="discipline">

            <h3>Micro Computers </h3>
            <p>Micro computers, often called personal computers (PCs), are the smallest among the 
                categories and designed primarily for individual users. They include desktops, laptops, tablets, 
                and smartphones and are intended mainly for personal tasks such as word processing, 
                internet browsing, gaming, and basic office applications. Micro computers are less powerful 
                than mini computers and generally do not support multiple users concurrently. They offer 
                portability and affordability, making them ubiquitous for everyday computing needs. </p>

        <h2>A COMPUTER HAVE THE FOLLOWING: </h2>
        <div class="topic3">

            <h4 style="text-align: left;">CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h4>
            <p>The CPU is the main component of a computer, often called the "brain" of the system. It 
                executes instructions from programs by performing arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output 
                operations. The CPU coordinates and processes data, allowing the computer to function and 
                carry out tasks. </p>
            <h4 style="text-align: left;">Memory</h4>
            <p>Memory in a computer refers to the storage area that holds data and instructions temporarily 
                while the CPU processes them. It includes primary memory like RAM (Random Access 
                Memory), which provides fast access to data for quick computing, and secondary storage like 
                hard drives or SSDs for long-term data retention. </p>
            <h4 style="text-align: left;">Processing Speed</h4>
            <p>Processing speed is the rate at which a computer's CPU executes instructions, typically 
                measured in gigahertz (GHz). Faster processing speeds allow the computer to perform more 
                calculations or tasks per second, improving system performance.  </p>
            <h4 style="text-align: left;">Calculating Power</h4>
            <p>Calculating power refers to a computer's ability to perform computations and mathematical 
                operations. It is influenced by the CPU architecture, number of cores, clock speed, and other 
                factors.   </p>
            <h4 style="text-align: left;">Working Principle  </h4>
            <p>This describes how a computer operates—by receiving input data, processing it according to 
                program instructions, storing information temporarily or permanently, and producing output. 
                Computers work under a control unit that sequences operations and an arithmetic-logic unit 
                that performs calculations.  </p>
            <h4 style="text-align: left;">Energy Consumption  </h4>
            <p>Energy consumption indicates how much electrical power a computer uses during operation. It 
                varies widely by computer type and configuration, from low power for microcomputers to very 
                high in supercomputers requiring substantial cooling systems.  </p>
            <h4 style="text-align: left;">Field of Use</h4>
            <p>Field of use refers to the typical application environment or tasks for which a computer type is 
                designed, such as personal computing, business data processing, scientific research, or large
                scale transaction handling. </p>

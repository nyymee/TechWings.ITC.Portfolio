        <h2>NUMBER SYSTEMS</h2>
        <div class="topic3">

            <p class="bullet">Number systems are systems of writing or representing numbers 
                using a set of digits or symbols in a consistent manner. They provide a mathematical 
                notation for expressing numbers and allow performing arithmetic operations. Numbers 
                represent values used for counting, measuring, or labeling, and each number system has 
                a base that defines the number of digits and its place values.</p>
            <p class="bullet">A number system is a way of expressing numbers in a consistent manner using 
                digits or other symbols. In the context of computers, a number system represents data and 
                performs operations at the machine level. Computers typically work with binary, octal, 
                decimal, and hexadecimal systems. These systems serve as the foundation for data encoding, 
                arithmetic operations, and other computations in computers.</p>

            <h2>TYPES OF NUMBER SYSTEMS</h2>

            <div class="discipline">

            <h3>BINARY NUMBER SYSTEM (BASE 2)</h3>
            <p class="bullet">The binary number system uses only two digits: 0 and 1. The numbers in this 
                system have a base of 2. Digits 0 and 1 are called bits and 8 bits together make a byte. The 
                data in computers is stored in terms of bits and bytes. The binary number system does not 
                deal with other numbers such as 2,3,4,5 and so on.</p>
            <p>Example: The binary number 1011 equals 1×23+0×22+1×21+1×20=111×23+0×22+1×21+1×20=11 in decimal.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="discipline">

            <h3>DECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM (BASE 10)</h3>
            <p class="bullet">The decimal number system uses ten digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 with the 
                base number as 10. The decimal number system is the system that we generally use to represent 
                numbers in real life. If any number is represented without a base, it means that its base is 10. </p>
            <p>Example: The number 345 means 3×102+4×101+5×1003×102+4×101+5×100</p>

            </div>
            <div class="discipline">

            <h3>OCTAL NUMBER SYSTEM (BASE 8)</h3>
            <p class="bullet">The octal number system uses eight digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 with the base of 8. 
                The advantage of this system is that it has lesser digits when compared to several other systems, 
                hence, there would be fewer computational errors. Digits like 8 and 9 are not included in the octal 
                number system. Just like the binary, the octal number system is used in minicomputers but with 
                digits from 0 to 7. </p>
            <p>Example: The octal number 157 means 1×82+5×81+7×80=1111×82+5×81+7×80=111 in decimal.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="discipline">

            <h3>HEXADECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM (BASE 16)</h3>
            <p class="bullet">The hexadecimal number system uses sixteen digits/alphabets: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 
                and A,B,C,D,E,F with the base number as 16. Here, A-F of the hexadecimal system means the numbers 
                10-15 of the decimal number system respectively. This system is used in computers to reduce the 
                large-sized strings of the binary system.</p>
            <p>Example: The hex number 2F means 2×161+15×160=472×161+15×160=47 in decimal.</p>

        <h2>USES/SIGNIFICANCE OF EACH NUMBER SYSTEMS</h2>

        <div class="topic3">

            <p>Each number system has its own significance and uses based on its properties.</p>
            <p class="bullet"> The decimal number system (base 10) is the most common and widely used in everyday life for 
                counting, measuring, financial transactions, and scientific calculations. It allows precise representation of 
                whole and fractional numbers, which is important in fields like banking, sports, medicine, engineering, 
                and construction.</p>
            <p class="bullet">The binary number system (base 2) is crucial in computing and digital electronics because 
                computers operate using two states (0 and 1). All data processing, memory addressing, and machine-level 
                operations in computers are based on binary. </p>
            <p class="bullet">The octal number system (base 8) is used mainly as a compact representation of binary numbers, 
                especially in programming and digital systems where grouping of bits (3 bits per octal digit) simplifies 
                reading and debugging.</p>
            <p class="bullet">The hexadecimal number system (base 16) is similarly significant in computer science for 
                representing binary-coded values more efficiently, commonly used in memory addresses and color codes in web design. </p>
            <p>Each system’s importance lies in its ability to simplify numerical representation and computation 
                in its respective domain.</p>

        <h2>ANALYSIS/REACTION</h2>

        <div class="topic3">

            <p class="indent"> Number systems play a very important role in programming. These are systems in mathematics 
                that are used to express numbers in various forms and are understood by computers. Computers represent data 
                with decimal numbers in different kinds of number systems. Knowing what these systems are will help you understand 
                how computers operate the way they do and process any kind of data effectively. </p>
            <p  class="indent">The programs work using the four types of number systems; binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal 
                systems. These systems serve as the foundation for data encoding, arithmetic operations, and other computations in 
                computers. There are four types of number systems. First, we have the binary number system, the most fundamental system 
                used in computers. It uses only two digits, 0 and 1, to represent all data. Because there are some electronic circuits 
                in a computer that can only understand two states. If you are given hexadecimal, octal, or decimal number systems, you 
                can convert them to binary and vice versa with the other number system. This is because not all systems can work in all
                of the number systems; this will differ in the type of system you use. Number systems are important because you can use 
                this in your everyday life, not just in programming. This will also represent the quantity and perform calculations in 
                various fields. The most common uses of number systems are counting, measuring, financial transactions, and scientific 
                calculations. </p>
            <p class="indent">Number systems are important for our everyday life, especially if we do programming or systems. You will 
                see that all those systems have the number system. It depends on the system because each number system has different usage 
                and you can convert them into what system you will use. Knowing number systems thoroughly is a big step towards understanding 
                computer organization, digital electronics, and software ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌development.</p>

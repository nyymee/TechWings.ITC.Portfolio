        <h2>THEIR IMPLEMENTATION IN THE DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY</h2>

        <div class="topic3">

            <h3>The Implementation of Computer Hardware</h3>
            <p>Computer hardware is implemented in community institutions like schools, 
                banks, and hospitals to perform tasks such as data management, communication, and specialized 
                operations, with varying hardware needs depending on the institution's function; for instance, 
                schools use standard PCs for teaching, hospitals need advanced medical equipment and data analysis systems, 
                and banks rely on robust servers for financial transactions. </p>
    
        </div>
        <div class="topic3">

            <h3>The Implementation of Software</h3>
            <p>Software implementation in community institutions involves integrating applications into the daily operations 
                of entities like schools and local government to improve efficiency, manage data, and automate tasks. This process 
                includes planning, installing software, migrating data, user training, and ensuring the system meets the institution's 
                specific needs for better service delivery, such as streamlined enrollment or transparent financial management. </p>
    
        </div>
        <div class="topic3">

            <h3>The Implementation of Types of Software</h3>
            <p>Software is implemented in different community institutions as System Software(like operating systems), 
                Application Software (such as word processors or databases for businesses, or educational software for schools), 
                Embedded Software (for public infrastructure), and Custom-Developed Software for specialized community needs. Institutions 
                like businesses, schools, hospitals, and government agencies use these types to perform various functions, from managing 
                operations and communication to patient care and public services.  </p>

        <!-- Analysis -->

        <h2>ANALYSIS/REACTION</h2>
        <div class="topic3">
            <p class="indent">The topic for this presentation provides a clear and organized overview of computer hardware and software. 
                A comprehensive yet simple discussion that provides a theory as well as the practice of information technology. 
                The presentation also provides an understanding of how technology works in both bigger organizational systems and in 
                daily life by organizing the material into definitions, categories, and applications.</p>
            <p  class="indent">It starts by defining hardware as the actual or physical part of a computer and making a difference between 
                the internal hardware that includes the motherboard, RAM, hard drives, and the external hardware that includes the monitors, 
                printers, and keyboards. Knowing the differences between the computer hardware and software helps people understand how 
                different parts contribute to the use and efficiency of a computer system. Defining these differences shows how internal 
                components are necessary for the computer to work, and external components improve the use and efficiency. The explanation 
                shows how both categories are important for a computer system to complete. The discussion about software is described as the 
                set of instructions that makes the hardware to work. The presentation demonstrates how computers work at both basic and user 
                levels by separating software into two categories: the system software and the application software. The types of system software 
                I included in the presentation are operating systems, device drivers, and language translators, while the application software 
                includes databases, multimedia, graphics, and web browsers.</p>
            <p class="indent">It also emphasizes on the implementation of hardware and software in the community. There are specific areas in 
                the community that implement both the software and hardware. For example, schools, which allow teaching and learning with the 
                help of common computers and educational programs, we have a hospital that uses a computer system to have the machines work, 
                records, and data management, banks also need this system to help track with the financial and many more in the community that uses 
                this system and it is a great help for our community. </p>
            <p class="indent">The topic highlights the role of both software and hardware. It describes both their uses and the types of software. 
                It shows where is this system is most likely to be found. The analysis I made reveals that the computer systems are not just tools 
                for people but a support institutional growth, innovation, and service delivery.</p>

        <h2>COMPUTER SCIENCE AS A DISCIPLINE</h2>
        <div class="topic3">
    
            <p class="bullet">Computer science is a multifaceted field that encompasses 
                scientific and engineering aspects, which are manifested in algorithmic 
                problem-solving processes.</p>
            <p class="bullet">The discipline of computer science was born in the early 
                1940s with the confluence of algorithm theory, mathematical logic, and 
                the invention of the stored-program electronic computer.</p>
            <p class="bullet">The discipline of computer science is the body of knowledge 
                and practices used by computing professionals in their work.</p>
            <p class="bullet">It encompasses practical areas like software development, 
                artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity, as well as theoretical subfields 
                focusing on the mathematical principles behind computation.</p>

            <h2>FIVE COMPUTING DISCIPLINES AND MAJORS</h2>

            <div class="discipline">

            <h3>COMPUTER ENGINEERING</h3>
            <p class="bullet">Computer Engineering is focused on computer architecture and 
                infrastructure, from the applied to the theoretical aspects. It also has an 
                interest in software methods (programming) insofar as it applies to the hardware 
                side of computing.</p>
            <p class="bullet">Computer Engineers are focused on the connection between hardware and 
                software. A dominant area within computing engineering is embedded systems: the 
                development of devices that have software and hardware embedded in them. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="discipline">

            <h3>COMPUTER SCIENCE</h3>
            <p class="bullet">Computer science has the widest range of computing topics. It focuses 
                especially on the theoretical aspects of computing, leaving the more applied topics 
                (and organizational and architecture issues) to other disciplines.</p>
            <p class="bullet">Computer Scientists develop a strong foundation based on mathematics and 
                algorithms. They are trained to discover the best solutions for new problems, generate new 
                technologies and come up with innovative cutting-edge ideas. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="discipline">

            <h3>INFORMATION SYSTEMS</h3>
            <p class="bullet">Information Systems is focused on the organizational issues of computing. 
                Information Systems also has an interested in the applied aspects of application technologies 
                and software development.</p>
            <p class="bullet">Information Systems specialists integrate information technology with business processes. 
                They focus on the processing of information, and must have an understanding of how organizations 
                and technology work. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="discipline">

            <h3>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</h3>
            <p class="bullet">Information Technology is focused on the applied side of computing. It covers all aspects 
                of technology infrastructure, including hardware, operating systems, applications, data storage and 
                communication systems. </p>
            <p class="bullet">Information Technology professionals provide customer service with a focus on technology. 
                They work to meet the computer technology needs of business, government, healthcare, schools, and other 
                kinds of organizations.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="discipline">

            <h3>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING</h3>
            <p class="bullet">Software Engineering is focused on everything (from applied to theoretical) related to 
                software methods, that is, writing software. Infrastructure and application technologies are also part of 
                software engineering.</p>
            <p class="bullet">Software Engineers develop and maintain large-scale software systems. Using the principles 
                of mathematics and computer science, and the practices of engineering, software engineers learn how to develop 
                software that meets costumer needs.</p>

        <!-- Analysis -->

        <h2>ANALYSIS/REACTION</h2>
        <div class="topic3">

            <p class="indent"> There are 5 computing disciplines and majors, mainly computer science, 
                computer engineering, software engineering, information technology, and information 
                systems. Selecting the correct computing degree discipline is important if you want to 
                look for an area of study and a career in technology and computers. Understanding these 
                computing disciplines and the abilities you will learn from studying them would help you 
                with your future career and choices. Each discipline offers a unique perspective and 
                approach to problem-solving, catering to different interests, and skills. </p>
            <p  class="indent">Computer engineering is more on hardware than on software, but Computer Engineers use both 
                for integrated devices. Computer Engineers apply engineering theories to the problems of 
                designing computers and computer-based devices. Software Engineering focuses more on software 
                reliability, and it focuses on the techniques for developing and maintaining appropriate 
                software solutions. Information Technology is responsible for planning and managing the entire 
                technology lifecycle; they integrate the software into the hardware. Information Systems studies 
                the combination of business and computing coursework, and may have a computing focus or a 
                management focus. Computer Science is the study of discovering the best solutions for new 
                problems, generating new technologies, and coming up with innovative, cutting-edge ideas. 
                The discipline of computer science shows the body of knowledge of computing and is frequently 
                described as the systematic study of algorithmic processes that describe and transform information: 
                their theory, analysis, design, efficiency, implementation, and application. Even though computer 
                science addresses both human-made and natural information processes, the main effort in the discipline 
                has been directed toward human-made processes, especially information processing systems and machines.</p>
            <p class="indent">Understanding and analyzing these disciplines of computing would be a great help to you with your 
                future career and choices. Each discipline offers a unique perspective and approach to problem-solving, catering 
                to different interests and skills. Knowing the differences would give you more knowledge of the track 
                you're into. </p>

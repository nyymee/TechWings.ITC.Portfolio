        <h2>WHAT IS A MOTHERBOARD?</h2>
        <div class="topic3">
    
            <p>The motherboard is a computer's backbone, serving as the primary platform where key components 
                like the CPU, RAM, and expansion cards are connected. It facilitates communication and power 
                distribution among these components and includes ports for external peripherals and storage devices. </p>

        <h2>WHAT IS A FORM FACTOR?</h2>
        <div class="topic3">
    
            <p >Each component is specifically designed to fit a certain size and design specifications in the hardware 
                world. This is especially true in computers, where internal hardware like motherboards, storage 
                drives, and memory modules vary widely in shape and size. This variation is referred to as the 'form factor.'</p>
             
        </div>
        <div class="topic3">

            <p class="bullet">Build: Refers to the physical size, shape, and design of the motherboard, including the layout 
                of components and the form factor (e.g., ATX, Micro ATX). It affects compatibility with PC 
                cases and cooling solutions.</p>
            <p class="bullet">CPU Slots: The number of sockets on the motherboard where the central processing unit 
                (CPU) is installed. Most consumer motherboards have one CPU slot; server/workstation 
                boards may have multiple. </p>
            <p class="bullet">Memory Slots: Slots where RAM (Random Access Memory) modules are installed. The 
                number determines how much memory can be added and supported.</p>
            <p class="bullet">Chipsets: Integrated circuits on the motherboard that manage data flow between the CPU, 
                memory, and peripherals. They determine compatibility, supported features, and expansion 
                capabilities. </p>
            <p class="bullet">BIOS: Basic Input/Output System firmware that initializes hardware during boot-up and 
                provides runtime services. Modern boards use UEFI, a more advanced BIOS. </p>
            <p class="bullet">PCI Slots: Slots that allow addition of expansion cards like graphics cards, sound cards, or 
                network cards. PCIe (PCI Express) is the current standard. </p>
            <p class="bullet">SATA: Serial ATA ports for connecting storage devices like hard drives and SSDs. They 
                support data transfer and power. </p>
            <p class="bullet">Builtin Features: Integrated capabilities on the motherboard such as audio, LAN (network), 
                USB ports, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RAID controllers, and more, reducing the need for extra cards.</p>

        <h2>Motherboards come in various types and sizes, catering to different needs and specifications of 
            computer systems. The most common types are: </h2>

        <div class="topic2">

            <div class="discipline">

            <h3 style="text-align: left;">AT Motherboard </h3>
            <p>If you want a PC with an extended ATX, than AT motherboard is the best choice as they have 
                bigger physical dimensions. You cannot use them for mini desktops. Apart from that you need 
                to add new drivers. For power connectors you need sockets and six-pin plugs. However, you 
                cannot identify them easily and so face issues in connecting them. In the 1980s AT 
                motherboards were used a lot. These are good for mid-range builds where you are looking for 
                expansion rather than storage.  </p>
    
        </div>
        <div class="discipline">

            <h3 style="text-align: left;">ATX Motherboard </h3>
            <p>ATX motherboards are the most common and versatile, supporting extensive expansion and 
                robust performance needs. They typically feature 4–8 RAM slots, up to 7 PCIe expansion 
                slots, multiple SATA/M.2 ports, and rich built-in connectivity like USB 3.2, Wi-Fi, and high
                quality sound. Their size allows for effective cooling and multiple GPUs, making them suited for 
                gaming and demanding applications. However, they require larger cases and are more 
                expensive than smaller types.   </p>

        </div>
        <div class="discipline">

            <h3 style="text-align: left;">BTX Motherboard  </h3>
            <p>BTX stands for Balanced Technology Extended. This motherboard focuses on new 
                technologies that fulfills all power requirements. However, it results in more heat and hence 
                Intel stopped creating BTX boards in the mid-2000s. They wanted to focus on low power 
                CPUs.  </p>

        </div>
        <div class="discipline">

            <h3 style="text-align: left;">Extended ATX (E-ATX) Motherboard  </h3>
            <p>E-ATX motherboards are larger than ATX, measuring up to 12 x 13 inches or more, with 
                support for 8+ RAM slots and multiple CPUs for workstations and servers. These boards allow 
                for maximum expandability, best cooling, and high-end features but require big cases and tend 
                to be costly.   </p>

        </div>
        <div class="discipline">

            <h3 style="text-align: left;">LPX Motherboard </h3>
            <p>LPX boards are compact and used mainly in older systems. Featuring riser cards for 
                expansion, they fit slim desktop cases but lack features like advanced graphics support and 
                have been replaced by newer standards.  </p>

        </div>
        <div class="discipline">

            <h3 style="text-align: left;">Micro ATX Motherboard </h3>
            <p>Micro ATX boards are smaller, usually offering up to 4 RAM slots and 4 PCIe slots. Despite 
                their compact size, they maintain many features of ATX, remain compatible with ATX cases, 
                and are cost-effective. Micro ATX is ideal for users prioritizing space and budget but with fewer 
                expansion options and sometimes limited cooling potential.  </p>

        </div>
        <div class="discipline">

            <h3 style="text-align: left;">Mini ITX Motherboard  </h3>
            <p>Mini ITX is the smallest mainstream form factor at 6.7 x 6.7 inches. With only 2 RAM slots and 
                one PCIe slot, Mini ITX boards focus on efficiency, low power, and compact builds for HTPCs 
                or minimalist setups. Advanced models can support power-user features, but there’s limited 
                expansion and airflow, and prices may be higher for high-performance ITX boards.   </p>

        </div>
        <div class="discipline">

            <h3 style="text-align: left;">Mini ATX Motherboard  </h3>
            <p>Mini ATX motherboard generally refers to the Micro ATX (mATX) form factor, which is a smaller 
                and more compact version of the standard ATX motherboard, typically measuring 9.6 by 9.6 
                inches (244 x 244 mm). Designed to fit into smaller cases while maintaining many features of 
                larger boards, Micro ATX supports a single CPU socket, around 2 to 4 RAM slots, and fewer 
                PCIe expansion slots (usually up to 4) compared to standard ATX motherboards. It balances 
                size, cost, and functionality, making it popular for budget-minded builds, office PCs, and 
                compact gaming rigs. Despite its smaller size, it retains compatibility with most ATX 
                components and cases, offering good performance in a more space-efficient form factor   </p>

        </div>
        <div class="discipline">

            <h3 style="text-align: left;">Extended ATX (E-ATX) Motherboard </h3>
            <p>E-ATX motherboards are larger than ATX, measuring up to 12 x 13 inches or more, with 
                support for 8+ RAM slots and multiple CPUs for workstations and servers. These boards allow 
                for maximum expandability, best cooling, and high-end features but require big cases and tend 
                to be costly.  </p>

        </div>
        <div class="discipline">

            <h3 style="text-align: left;">Pico BTX motherboard  </h3>
            <p>Pico BTX are smaller in size and the best choice if you are planning to develop a Hackintosh 
                (desktop Mac) computer. There are two expansion slots and riser cards so as to meet all the 
                digital application needs. If the space is your premium need, you can go for these types of 
                computer motherboards.  </p>

        <h2>DATA AND INFORMATION</h2>

        <div class="topic3">

            <h2>Data</h2>
            <p class="bullet">Data represents raw elements or unprocessed facts, from numerical 
                values and symbolic representations to textual content and visual imagery.</p>
            <p class="bullet">When collected and observed without interpretation, these elements 
                remain mere data points—discrete and disorganized entities lacking inherent meaning or significance.</p>
            <p class="bullet">Data comes in various forms. Specifically, it can be categorized into 
                two categories: quantitative and qualitative data.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="discipline">

                <h2>The two categories of Data:</h2>
                <h3 style="text-align: left;""> 1. Quantitative data</h3>
                <p>-This data type is numerical and measurable, dealing with quantities and values that can be 
                    expressed mathematically, like an item’s weight, volume, or cost. </p>
                <p>-The two types of quantitative data are: </p>
                <p class="bullet">Discrete data - involves finite values that can be counted, often 
                    represented by whole numbers.</p>
                <p class="bullet">Continuous data - represents values infinitely subdivided within a
                    range, offering precise measurements for attributes like height, weight, temperature, and duration.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="discipline">

                <h3 style="text-align: left;">2. Qualitative data</h3>
                <p>-This type is descriptive and non-numerical, focusing on qualities and attributes that cannot 
                    be measured with numbers. It’s often subjective and interpretive.</p>
                <p>-There are two fundamental types of qualitative data:</p>
                <p class="bullet">Nominal data - classifies elements into distinct categories where no ranking or 
                    order is implied, such as gender and nationality.</p>
                <p class="bullet">Ordinal data - establishes a ranked order of categories, indicating relative 
                    position without specifying the exact distance between them. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="topic3">

            <h2>Information</h2>
            <p class="bullet">You get information when data is processed, organized, interpreted, 
                and structured.</p>
            <p class="bullet">The comprehensible output derived from raw data helps inform decisions, 
                strategies, and actions. Information is data made valuable and accessible—an integral 
                component of decision-making.</p>
            <p class="bullet">Every successful business decision starts with reliable, relevant information.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="topic3">

                <h3>Converting data to information involves the following steps:</h3>
                <p>1. Processing: This involves cleaning and preparing data for analysis. </p>
                <p>2. Organizing: Data is structured and categorized to facilitate understanding and retrieval.</p>
                <p>3. Interpreting: This step refines data into actionable insights by uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships. </p>
                <p>4. Structuring: Finally, information is presented concisely and is accessible.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="topic3">

            <h3>What Is the Difference Between Data and Information?</h3>
            <p>Information becomes a dynamic resource that empowers individuals and organizations within a knowledge 
                management system. Therefore, in data vs. information, both forms of knowledge are critical versions of 
                insights that drive decision-making. In addition, with today’s digital landscape, data is not simply converted 
                to general information but to a type and quality that supports machine learning. </p>

        <h2>INFORMATION SYSTEMS</h2>

        <div class="topic3">

            <p class="bullet">Information Systems is focused on the organizational issues of computing. Information 
                Systems also has an interested in the applied aspects of application technologies and software development.</p>
            <p class="bullet">An integrated set of components for collecting, storing, and processing data and for providing 
                information, knowledge, and digital products.</p>
            <p class="bullet">Information systems are used to run interorganizational supply chains and electronic markets.</p>
            <p class="bullet">Business firms and other organizations rely on information systems to carry out and manage 
                their operations, interact with their customers and suppliers, and compete in the marketplace.</p>

        <h2>DIFFERENT TYPES OF SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS</h2>

        <div class="topic3">

            <p class="bullet">There are six primary types of information systems. Although information systems are not 
                limited to this list, typical businesses and organizations have the following six, each system supporting a 
                different organizational level.</p>
            <p class="bullet">We have the transaction processing systems (TPS) at the operational level. Next are the 
                office automation systems (OAS) and knowledge work systems (KWS), both at the knowledge level. Next, the
                management level has the management information systems (MIS) and decision support systems (DSS), and 
                we conclude with the executive support systems (ESS) at the strategic level.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="topic2">

            <div class="discipline">

            <h3>1. Transaction Processing System (TPS)</h3>
            <p class="bullet">Transaction processing is essential to helping businesses perform daily operations. </p>
            <p class="bullet">It collects, modifies, and processes the data of business transactions. It boosts the 
                performance and reliability of the business transactions. It processes large amounts of data in real time 
                and thus offers customer satisfaction.</p>
            <p class="bullet">Transactions are any activity or event affecting the company and include deposits, 
                withdrawals, shipping, billing customers, order entry, and order placement. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="discipline">

            <h3>2. Office Automation System (OAS)</h3>
            <p class="bullet">Office automation systems (OAS) automate scheduling, project tracking, email handling, 
                document management, and other administrative tasks. </p>
            <p class="bullet">OAS comprises computers, communication-related technology, and personnel 
                assigned to perform official tasks.</p>
            <p class="bullet">It covers office transactions and supports official activity at every level in
                the organization, subdivided into managerial and clerical activities.</p>
            <h3>Office automation systems include the following applications:</h3>
            <p class="bullet">Email: The email application also covers file attachments such as audio, video, and documents.</p>
            <p class="bullet">Voice Mail: This application records and stores phone messages in the system’s memory, 
                which can be retrieved anytime.</p>
            <p class="bullet">Word Processing: Word processing covers the creation of documents, including memos, 
                reports, letters, and anything else that’s printable electronically.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="discipline">

            <h3>3. Knowledge Work System (KWS)</h3>
            <p class="bullet">The KWS is a specialized system that expedites knowledge creation and ensures the business's 
                technical skills and knowledge are correctly applied</p>
            <p class="bullet">These are software tools that collect, organize, and share knowledge within organizations</p>
            <p class="bullet">The Knowledge Work System aids workers in creating and disseminating new information using 
                graphics, communication, and document management tools. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="discipline">

            <h3>4. Management Information System (MIS)</h3>
            <p class="bullet">Management Information Systems are designed to help middle managers and supervisors make 
                decisions, plan, and control the workflow. </p>
            <p class="bullet">This system takes the raw data generated from TPS as its input. It then converts it into a 
                form like a report for the manager.</p>
            <p class="bullet">The system compares and summarizes the data and then generates the report. The reports can be 
                summary, ad hoc, reports-on-demand, etc. These reports help the management control and predict the company's 
                future performance.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="discipline">

            <h3>5. Decision Support System (DSS)</h3>
            <p class="bullet">DSS is an information system that helps in making decisions. It gathers and computes relevant 
                information.</p>
            <p class="bullet">Decision Support Systems use different decision models to analyze or summarize large amounts of 
                data into an easy-to-use form that makes it easier for managers to compare and analyze information.</p>
            <p class="bullet">The Decision Support System gives middle managers the information necessary to make informed, 
                intelligent decisions.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="discipline">
                
            <h3>6. Executive Support System (ESS)</h3>
            <p class="bullet">The ESS is like the MIS but for executive-level decision-making. Because the decisions involve 
                company-wide matters, the stakes are higher, and they demand more insight and judgment. </p>
            <p class="bullet">The ESS provides greater telecommunication, better computing capabilities, and more efficient 
                display options than the DSS.</p>
            <p class="bullet">Executives use ESS to make effective decisions based on summarized internal data taken from DSS, 
                MIS, and external sources.</p>

        <h2>ANALYSIS/REACTION</h2>

        <div class="topic3">

            <p class="indent"> Data and information are different, but they are important, especially in systems. Data is defined 
                as individual facts, while information is the organization and interpretation of those facts. Information systems 
                is part of this topic, this is a group of parts that work together to gather, store, analyze, and send data and digital 
                information. There are a lot different types of support systems in Information Systems but I have included six the 
                primary types of information systems.</p>
            <p  class="indent">The data needs to be analyzed and understood to be converted into a meaningful form. To turn data into 
                information, it has to be put in context, sorted, computed, and shortened. So, the connection between data and information 
                is one of transformation. It is important that you get to analyze and understand the difference and connection between 
                data and information for your system. They are connected in a way that if there is no data, there is no information, and 
                vice versa. These two can be seen in Information Systems. An information system is a structured system that helps manage 
                issues, avoid mistakes, and make things safer. It does this by giving users, like operators, simple, easy-to-understand 
                information about its operations, capabilities, and limitations.</p>
            <p class="indent">Information Systems have a lot of support systems, but I only chose the six primary types. First we have 
                the Transaction Processing System (TPS), this is essential to helping companies in performing their regular tasks. 
                Transactions include deposits, withdrawals, shipping, customer billing, order entry, and order placing, and they include 
                any event or activity that has an impact on the business. We have an Office Automation System (OAS) that comprises computers, 
                communication-related technology, and personnel assigned to perform official tasks. Knowledge Work System (KWS), one of the 
                knowledge management systems that ease the integration of new information or knowledge into the business process. Management 
                Information System (MIS), collects and process operational information from different sources and provides managers with the 
                information they need for making decisions. Decision Support System (DSS), designed to help managers make decisions by 
                providing them with tools to gain insights into good business problems. Executive Support System (ESS), helps top-level 
                executives to plan and control workflow and make business decisions. </p>
            <p class="indent">It is important to analyze and understand these, because this is required especially if you have a business. 
                For your business to run, you need to evaluate these to further develop the system in your business. </p>
